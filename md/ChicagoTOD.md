**Project description:** 
The TOD (Transit Oriented Development) played important role in urban planning as it brings increased housing and amenity densities around public transportation. TOD can help urban researchers optimize urban spatial structure. To explore the geospatial effects and potential of TOD, we studies the TOD in Chicago for the year 2000 and 2017. We chose some demographic and socioeconomic variables and the crime data within 0.5 mile of rail stations, then compared those variables across time and space (TOD vs. non-TOD area).
