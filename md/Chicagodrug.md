**Project description:** 
Data science has been an ideal planning tool, which makes sure that the limited resources (e.g. police) matches the demand for resources (e.g. crime). For many years, policies have been planning based on the crime data for a better risk prediction. Under this premise, this study created a geospatial risk-predicted model to predict the drug crimes in Chicago. First, drug crime data with its relevant risk factors were wrangled into geospatial features. Their correlations were analyzed and based on that, estimating models were built to predict the drug crime in Chicago. Finally, model validation is conducted by comparing the predictions with the traditions.
