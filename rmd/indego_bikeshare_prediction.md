**Project description:** 
Bike share is that public bicycles, usually next to subways, bus stations, parks, residential and shopping area, are provided for individuals to satisfy their short-term travelling demand by paying rent according to their travelling time. Nowadays it has been widely developed in many metropolitan regions, such as Philadelphia and NYC, to bring travelers with convenience and health benefits, and contribute to the environment their live.

Despite such benefits, during peak travelling time when people commute to school or work, commuters usually can not find a sharing bike, or do not know where to return the bike since bike stations can be either full vacant during this time, which will cause delay and inconvenience for their travelling. The spatial and time distribution of travellers’ demand is extremely uneven. To prevent such problems, organizers of bike share system should allocate the bike sharing rationally and evenly. This is called rebalancing, a key issue in bike-sharing system.

For organizers, the demand of travellers should be matched with the supply of bike share timely as possible. This requires in-depth studies of travellers’ characteristics according to their spatial and temporal distribution with bike sharing. Under this context, this study forecasts the ride share demand in Philadelphia based on the start and end station of each bike-sharing traveller. The prediction results will help organizers make better decisions for the management of bike share system in Philadelphia.
