**Project description:** 
Most organizations are client-based. The government and enterprises work on behalf of houseowners. For example, the promise of Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) is to attract eligible homeowners who can enroll the home repair tax credit program, but only 11% of eligible homeowners can take the credit. Due to potential risks as well as opportunites, most homeowners choose not to take the credit.To reach the goal of HCD, a decision-making model should be built and cost/benefit analysis should then be conducted. This study focused on the governmental resource allocation for company based on the client-level data and conducted the resulting intelligence for cost/benefit analysis. The decision of not taking credit can be predicted, which can guide HCD how to allocate their limited outreach resources more effectively.
